# CPP Modules ‚Äì 42 Cursus


Welcome to my repository for the **42 C++ Modules project**.  
This set of modules aims to progressively build up your knowledge of C++ features, from basic object-oriented programming to templates and efficient algorithms.

### üìö Overview

| Module   | Main Topic                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `cpp00`  | Classes, objects, public/private members     |
| `cpp01`  | Operators, references, pointers, streams     |
| `cpp02`  | Canonical Form, class design                 |
| `cpp03`  | Inheritance and polymorphism                 |
| `cpp04`  | Deeper inheritance, abstract classes         |
| `cpp05`  | Exception handling                           |
| `cpp06`  | Type conversion, input analysis              |
| `cpp07`  | Templates (functions and classes)            |
| `cpp08`  | Custom containers, iterators                 |
| `cpp09`  | STL, efficient sorting, Jacobsthal sequence  |

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Compiler: `c++`
- Standard: `-std=c++98`
- Recommended flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- OS: Linux or macOS

Each module includes its own `Makefile`.

---

### üß† What You Learn

- Object-oriented programming principles
- Memory management, constructors/destructors
- Inheritance and runtime polymorphism
- Exception handling
- Templates and metaprogramming
- Data structures and algorithms
- Use of the STL and performance analysis

---

### üöÄ How to Use

Each folder (`cpp00`, `cpp01`, ...) contains exercises and a `README.md`. You can compile each like this:

```bash
cd cppXX
make
```
