# CPP06 - Type Conversion in C++

## 📌 Overview
The **CPP06** module at **42 School** focuses on **type conversions** in C++, particularly between **scalar types** (`char`, `int`, `float`, `double`).  
The goal is to understand how to safely convert values while avoiding common issues such as **precision loss or invalid conversions**.

---

## 📂 **Exercises**
### ✅ **ex00: ScalarConverter**
- Implement a `ScalarConverter` class that converts a **string** into different scalar types (`char`, `int`, `float`, `double`).
- Correctly handle special values such as `nan`, `inf`, `-inf`.
- Ensure the output format follows the **subject**.

📌 **Usage:**  
```sh
$ ./ex00 42
Char: '*'
Int: 42
Float: 42.0f
Double: 42.0

$ ./ex00 nan
Char: impossible
Int: impossible
Float: nanf
Double: nan
```

---

### ✅ **ex01: Serialization**
- Implement a **simple data serialization and deserialization** mechanism.
- Convert a `Data` structure into a `uintptr_t` and back without losing information.
- Understand **bitwise operations and memory representation**.

📌 **Usage:**  
```sh
$ ./ex01
Original pointer: 0x600003de0
Serialized: 10569887424
Deserialized pointer: 0x600003de0
```

---

### ✅ **ex02: Dynamic Casting**
- Implement **polymorphism and dynamic casting** using `dynamic_cast`.
- Create a base class and multiple derived classes.
- Generate random objects and identify them at runtime.

📌 **Usage:**  
```sh
$ ./ex02
A
C
B
```

---

## ⚙️ **Compilation & Execution**
To compile and execute the exercises, run:  
```sh
$ make
$ ./ex00 <value>
$ ./ex01
$ ./ex02
```
To clean generated files:  
```sh
$ make fclean
```

## 📌 **Key Concepts**
✅ Implicit and explicit type conversions between `char`, `int`, `float`, `double`.  
✅ Safe casting with `static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `const_cast`, and `dynamic_cast`.  
✅ Handling special floating-point values like `NaN` and `Inf`.  
✅ Understanding memory representation and serialization.  
✅ Using **polymorphism** and **dynamic casting** in C++.
